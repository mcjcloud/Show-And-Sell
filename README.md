###Overview
When we began this project, we began with the following specifications in mind:
>Create a mobile application that would allow a platform for a digital yard sale to raise funds to attend NLC. The app should allow for the donation of items, including picture, suggested price, and a rating for the condition of the item. The app should allow for interaction/comments on the items. Code should be error free.

We believe that with Show & Sell, we have gone above and beyond these guidelines. Our application strives to be the most powerful, easiest-to-use platform for hosting digital yard sales, thanks to its inclusion of the following features:

* Item Donation, including a picture, suggested price, item condition, and more details about the item
* Commenting threads on items
* Bookmarking items for quick future reference
* Full support for online purchasing using the Braintree Payments API
* Creation of multiple yard sales/groups
* Group management, including deleting, editing, and approving items in your group
* Anti-abuse protections
* Finding nearby groups based on the user's location
* Searching for items and groups
* Help section
* Account creation and login with email or Google OAuth
* Sharing items via Twitter
* Deep links into the app from Twitter
* Both Apple and Android versions of the app, each with a user-friendly UI that fits well with native design patterns

With Show & Sell, we empower FBLA chapters and other organizations to mobilize their members and the community to harness the power of mobile technology to raise funds from the sale of donated items.
